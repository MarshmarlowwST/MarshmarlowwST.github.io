                <p>Words cannot describe how happy you've been making me these past couple of months, you make me feel so special and you make me just feel the happiest like, in the world. I enjoy and cherish every second we have together, I want to continue spending all my time with you and just enjoy every moment with you because I don't think I ever want to spend my time with anyone else. You are my soulmate, and you are my lover. I love you so so so so so so much words cant even express the amount of love I have for you. I hope you continue to stay with me and we spend all of our future together forever.</p>
